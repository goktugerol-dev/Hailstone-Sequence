# Hailstone-Sequence

The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture or the hailstone sequence, is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It is a simple conjecture that can be described as follows:

Start with any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Continue this process with the resulting number, and so on. The conjecture is that no matter what positive integer n you start with, you will always eventually reach the number 1.

For example, starting with the number 6:

6 is even, so divide it by 2 to get 3.
3 is odd, so multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get 10.
10 is even, so divide it by 2 to get 5.
5 is odd, so multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get 16.
16 is even, so divide it by 2 to get 8.
8 is even, so divide it by 2 to get 4.
4 is even, so divide it by 2 to get 2.
2 is even, so divide it by 2 to get 1.
The conjecture is that no matter what positive integer n you start with, you will always eventually reach the number 1.

Despite its simplicity, the Collatz conjecture remains an unsolved problem in mathematics. Although the conjecture has been tested for all positive integers up to 10^18, no one has been able to prove that it is true for all possible values of n.
